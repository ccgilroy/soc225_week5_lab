# Why? 

1. **R is free and open source.** You don't have to pay anything to download and use it, and you can keep using it after this class and after you graduate. 

2. **R has a vibrant community.** Many people use R for data science, and they've created tools, written tutorials, and answered almost any questions you might have online. Using R makes you part of this community. 

3. **R packages can do whatever you want.** R's strength is its ecosystem of packages. These extensions of R, developed by the community, provide tools for any programming or data analysis problem imaginable. You aren't confined to the built-in capacities of the program. 

# Install R

R is a programming language, originally designed for statistics. It's one of the two most common languages for data science. 

To install R, go to this website and click the appropriate link for your computer's operating system: https://cloud.r-project.org/

I'd recommend the most recent version of R, which is 3.5.1. You'll want to update your R version occasionally. 

# Install RStudio

RStudio is a convenient environment or interface for using R. RStudio is also free to use, and makes using R much easier and more pleasant. 

Download the desktop version of RStudio for your laptop using the appropriate Installer here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

# Try it out

Open RStudio and test out your R setup. Start by installing the tidyverse (`install.packages("tidyverse")`) and loading it (`library(tidyverse)`). Let me know if you have questions!
